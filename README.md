# Predicting-Song-Genres
In this project, I utilized some machine learning algorithms to see if they could predict the genre of a song. In Spotify, I created one playlist for metal and another for pop. I then used Spotify's API to extract the songs and necessary information. Using the Python libraries pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, I performed some data analysis to outline the differences in each genre. Finally, I used scikit-learn to test and train the Support Machine Vector and Logistic Regression algorithms. In the end, I found that the Support Machine Vector algorithm produced the best results.

NOTE: My Jupyter notebook doesn't seem to be loading properly in Github. For instance, my pandas dataframes do not have lines seperating the rows and columns. This seems to be a problem with Github, since everything looks nice and pretty when I open up the actual Jupyter notebook file on my computer.
